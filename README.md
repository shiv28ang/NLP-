# nlp-project
This is the course project for Natural Language Processing. In this project, we have used different Natural Language Processing models to analyze a book "The Alchemist". We have applied PoS tagging and created a Bi-gram table using the NLP frameworks defined in Python. 
The Original book is uploaded in pdf as well as txt format. Then we have eliminated some irrelevant information from it to make it suitable for Bi-gram model testing. Both "bigram modelling" and "testing" files are 
uploaded in txt format.
